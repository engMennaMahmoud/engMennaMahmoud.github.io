## Outreachy Blog - Introducing myself!

Hello everyone, Thanks for dropping by!

I am Menna, an Outreachy intern. I am from Egypt. My interest usually lies in C/C++ programming and contributing to open source.

I have been accepted as an Outreachy intern for May to August 2023 round. I'm interning for Linux Kernel Project "Improving Linux Security via Architectural Capabilities (Morello-Linux)". I am looking forward to having a great experience this summer.

Youâ€™d usually find me listening to music, watching series in my spare time. I am a music lover.

### What is Outreachy?

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
