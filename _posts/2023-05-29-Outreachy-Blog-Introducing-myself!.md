## Outreachy Blog - Introducing myself!

Hello everyone, Thanks for dropping by!

I am Menna, an Outreachy intern. I am from Egypt. My interest usually lies in C/C++ programming and contributing to open source.

I have been accepted as an Outreachy intern for May to August 2023 round. I'm interning for Linux Kernel Project "Improving Linux Security via Architectural Capabilities (Morello-Linux)". I am looking forward to having a great experience this summer.

You’d usually find me listening to music, watching series in my spare time. I am a music lover.
