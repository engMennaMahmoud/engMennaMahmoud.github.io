## Outreachy Blog - Introducing myself!

Hello everyone, Thanks for dropping by!

I am Menna, an Outreachy intern. I am from Egypt. My interest usually lies in C/C++ programming and contributing to open source.

I have been accepted as an Outreachy intern for May to August 2023 round. I'm interning for Linux Kernel Project "Improving Linux Security via Architectural Capabilities (Morello-Linux)". I am looking forward to having a great experience this summer.

Youâ€™d usually find me listening to music, watching series in my spare time. I am a music lover.

### What is Outreachy?

Outreachy provides three-month internships for people from groups traditionally underrepresented in tech. Interns are paid a stipend of $7,000. Both interns and mentors work remotely. This program is conducted twice a year.

#### My core values are:

- Curiosity - I value curiosity, the desire to learn or know about what interests me drives me to achieve my goal.
- Growth - I think investing a considerable amount of time and energy in one's personal development is needed for one's growth.
- Compassion - I value compassion, it drives our commitment to serve others with empathy and respect.
