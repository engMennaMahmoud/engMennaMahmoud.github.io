This post is a way to express publicly that everybody struggles.

Even the task of writing about it is challenging to me, because I did not use to communicating about things that stuck me. So, just this post was something that struggled me. I should write in a language different from mine, and I should expose what makes me feel uncomfortable.

Starting the Outreachy internship was a nice experience. I started to see Linux OS in a different form. The application process was my first struggle. I should make some contributions, but I did not know how relevant these contributions should be.
I followed the Outreachy tutorial: https://kernelnewbies.org/OutreachyIntro.
The First Steps tutorial: https://kernelnewbies.org/FirstKernelPatch
Made my first patch andâ€¦ stuck! How could I sent it?
I decided to talk to one Linux Kernel mentor. He helped me to install, and configure neomutt (https://neomutt.org/). Then, he shows me that I could use neomutt to send my patches.
Once finished, my first patches were revised and I realize that I did not even know how to describe in a what I did (how could I write good commit messages?).
Then, I talked with the mentors and got help. I improved my patches, its descriptions and resent themâ€¦ One more issueâ€¦ I did not produce good changes in the code however, they were a good starting point. Another update, and resentâ€¦ ACCEPTED!
WOW, it was awesome when I received this notice! It makes me more courageous to continue.
The same happens after I start the internship task. I sent one patchset, but I forgot to add one configuration parameters when I create it. Result: Result: I sent every patch individually. (What a shame!) However, the community reviewed my patches and kindly told me to send them together.
Later, I should make some tests pass on VKMS module. I could not even make tests run ðŸ˜¦ It takes me a lot of time. After many hours spent with my mentorâ€™s help, I could finally run the tests.
NOW, I have no idea how it failsâ€¦ So, this is my actual struggle!
This way shows me that it is normal to struggle many times, but I can go through this and asking and searching I can find a way to solve them (and many ways of how not to do).
Do not worry if something is making you frustrated and stuck. Everybody struggles, and it is okay
