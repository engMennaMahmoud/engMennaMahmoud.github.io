This post is a way to express publicly that everybody struggles.

Even the task of writing about it is challenging to me, because I did not use to communicating about things that stuck me. So, just this post was something that struggled me. I should write in a language different from mine, and I should expose what makes me feel uncomfortable.

Starting the Outreachy internship was a nice experience. I started to see Linux OS in a different form. The application process was my first struggle. I should make some contributions, but I did not know how relevant these contributions should be. I followed the Outreachy tutorial: https://kernelnewbies.org/OutreachyIntro. The First Steps tutorial: https://kernelnewbies.org/FirstKernelPatch

Once finished, my first patches were revised and I realize that I did not even know how to describe in a what I did (how could I write good commit messages?).
Then, I talked with the mentors and got help. I improved my patches, its descriptions and resent them… One more issue… I did not produce good changes in the code however, they were a good starting point. Another update, and resent… ACCEPTED!

WOW, it was awesome when I received this notice! It makes me more courageous to continue.
The same happens after I start the internship task. The tasks were how to run Morello Linux using FVP and docker, and work on security configurations for Morello.
I couldn't to do that easily and couldn't find detailed tutorial that help me about setup and run specific morello image on FVP.It takes me a lot of time. After many hours spent with my mentor’s help, I could finally compile Morello and work on its configurations.

This way shows me that it is normal to struggle many times, but I can go through this and asking and searching I can find a way to solve them (and many ways of how not to do).
Do not worry if something is making you frustrated and stuck. Everybody struggles, and it is okay
